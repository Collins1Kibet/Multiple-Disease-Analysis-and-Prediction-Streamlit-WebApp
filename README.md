# prediction
This project seeks to predict diseases based on symptoms.

# Diseases explored include:
1. Allergy, Cold, Covid-19 and Flu
2. Heart Disease
3. Diabetes
4. Parkinson's Disease
5. Breast Cancer

# Datasets
Sources of the Datasets:

Allergy, Cold, Covid19 or Flu detection:

Breast Cancer: This is from sklearn dataframe


# Project Structure
After each dataset was analyzed and a model for each disease prediction was trained and saved:
1. Five disease categories are set up in the navigation menu, each containing options for their respective prediction pages.
2. Each prediction page is linked to a respective model that uses support vector classification or logistic regression to predict the results.
3. Predictions are determined from the user's input based on relevant symptom features of a disease.
4. Users can easily obtain a broad overview of their health condition.

# Project Deployment
After modeling, the project is deployed on Streamlit Cloud using Streamlit libraries to make it available for public use.
